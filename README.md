open8 is a PICO-8 emulator written in C99, currently under active development.
Designed for portability, it aims to run on a wide range of platforms, including
the Nokia N-Gage. Any system supported by SDL3 should be capable of running open8.

This project is built on [Simple DirectMedia Layer 3](https://www.libsdl.org/).
